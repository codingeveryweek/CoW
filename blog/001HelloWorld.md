# Hello World

Kicking off CoW with hello world. Nothing special here but I thought the repo would not be complete without it. Only challenge was revisiting the basics of GNU makefile as I wanted to get started in Linux environment. The makefile is a bit rough but should work for now. As I add more projects I will make the makefile more robust or move to something like Bazel.
