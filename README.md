# CoW - Coding Every Week

Welcome, this is just a small random thing I started. It is mostly a personal project just to gain some more coding experience, or at least a different sort of experinece. I have worked as a professional developer for 15 years but looking for outlets to do different types of development. Here I will focus on low level fundamentals. Lets think of different ways to implement a list or algorithms rather then picking the popular library. Something does seem right about a typescript project with hundreds of NPM dependencies. I want something where I have written and understand almost every single line of code, should be fun right?
